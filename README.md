# Supply-Demand-Matcher
We voluntarily share information about our goals, needs, wants, offerings, skills, interests. The information is accessible and processable to all.

It was mr. Jacque Fresco who first got me thinking about a ‘Resource Based Economy’. A system not based on money and markets, but a planned economy that starts from a survey of the worlds’ resources, and uses scientific planning to fulfill the needs of the population.

The resource based economy always seemed too much top down. When I later became an anarchist, I came up with this idea.
The earths resources can be self reported to a public database. Human resources, non human resources. What are you good at? What are your qualifications? What assets do you own?
The earths needs and goals can be added similarly.



When looking for work, or deciding on an education, having access to the self reported information of billions of fellow humans can be highly beneficial. And sometimes you’re just bored, and you want to contribute to the world. The AI can investigate what you’re good at, what you deem important. It suggest paths of education, it can guide a user to where he is most useful.

So this is a platform where any information that a user discloses is useful.
If you like ice cream- you can get adverisements
If you like to cook spaghetti-you can find people who like spaghetti, and suppliers can find you
You can use the app for dating
For shopping
For giving and receiving counselling
For offering educational services and finding teachers or students
And it goes on and on..



That’s the power of sharing. Information for all.

Social media lets you debate random users. It’s good for gaining wisdom.

Callaborative Information Sharing gives the web a coordinating layer.
